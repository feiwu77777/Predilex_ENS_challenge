# Predilex ENS challenge

This project contains code for an online [Machine Learning Competition](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/24). This challenge is in relation with french jurisprudence texts. Those texts are judiciary texts that describe how a victim was involved in an accident and if the victim eventually recovered from the accident (consolidation).

The goal of the challenge is to leverage the resources of Machine Learning to create a system that will be able to automatically retrieve the gender of the victim, the date of accident and the date of consolidation from these texts.
